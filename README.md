This repository holds my JUnit testing project for SNHU CS 320.

**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**

As a developer, it is important to always build functional and secure code. To ensure this I test often and constantly strive to build clean and efficient code.

**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**

I think about how the user will interact with the software. Based on my hypotheses, I build and test the software to operate the way it is expected to.

-----

**How do I approach designing software?**

As abovementioned, I think about the user and how they will interact with the software, and what they _want_ to see as a feature. I also think about improvements I would like to see in systems that share similarities.
